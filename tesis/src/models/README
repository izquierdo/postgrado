Model enumerator for d-DNNF theories.
This code has been tested in SOLARIS/SPARC and Linux systems..

INSTALL

1. if you have a working GMP library, uncomment -DMP and -lgmp in makefiles, and fix GMP variable
   (if no MP is available, counting is performed with floats; some Linux come with GMP as standard library)
2. at nnf dir, do make
3. at top-level dir, do make

USAGE

1. try: ./models examples/ex1.nnf
   should get something like:

     Model enumerator for d-DNNF theories.
     Universidad Simon Bolivar, 2006.
     main: reading file 'examples/ex1.nnf' : 0.106533 seconds
